# Docker

If you're working on a Linux workstation you may prefer to use Docker in development rather than Virtual Box.

You can also run Docker inside Virtual Box if you're on a Mac or Windows.

There are instructions on how to build docker containers for both mongodb and redis.

Please see the `mongodb.md` and `redis.md` documents.
